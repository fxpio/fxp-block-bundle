The Sonatra BlockBundle provides tools for defining UI blocks, rendering and mapping
response data to related models. This bundle can easily create user interface elements,
and render the fields of an object in the locale/currency desired. It was intended as a
basis for designing elements of user interface, such as, panel, navbar, sidebar, data
table/grid, etc...

It was largely inspired by the [Symfony Form](https://github.com/symfony/form) in all
the features available in this bundle.

Features include:

- All features of [Sonatra Block](https://github.com/sonatra/sonatra-block)
- Compiler pass to register blocks
- Compiler pass to register block extensions
- Compiler pass to register block templates
- Compiler pass to register block aliases
